# Week 1-2 Priorities - Formation Phase

## Focus Areas

1. **Git History Review** (Priority 1)
   - Review all commits from last 30 days
   - Create timeline of work
   - Identify patterns: what worked, what didn't
   - Note recurring problems
   - Formulate questions
   
2. **Anthropic Skills Documentation Study** (Priority 1)
   - Read official Skills documentation thoroughly
   - Focus on: context preservation, progressive disclosure, sub-agent patterns
   - Understand: Skills preserve YOUR context through delegation
   - Take notes on key principles
   
3. **Reflective Practice Setup** (Priority 1)
   - Create scratchpad system (continuous capture)
   - Begin daily journal entries (5-10 min end of day)
   - Format: Date, Tasks, Successes, Challenges, Learnings, Questions, Tomorrow
   
4. **Lab Tech Structure** (Priority 2)
   - Understand lab tech roles (Lead, Red, Blue)
   - Review "lunch table" model
   - Be ready to invoke them for technical discussions

## Deliverables by End of Week 2

- [ ] 30-day git retrospective document
- [ ] Notes on Skills architecture in journal
- [ ] Active scratchpad with entries
- [ ] 5-10 daily journal entries
- [ ] Lab tech structure understood

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping scratchpad because "I'll remember" (you won't!)
- Making journal too formal (kills the habit)
- Not studying Skills docs thoroughly before trying to create skills
- Trying to do everything perfectly instead of starting

## Remember

Research first: IDENTIFY → RESEARCH → PLAN → TEST → ITERATE

You'll be wrong most of the time. That's the job.
