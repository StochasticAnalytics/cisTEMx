# {Skill Name} Decision Framework

Systematic decision-making for {domain/context}. Load this skill when facing {types of decisions}.

## Decision Scope

### What This Decides
- {Decision type 1}: {specific examples}
- {Decision type 2}: {specific examples}
- {Decision type 3}: {specific examples}

### What This Does NOT Decide
- {Out of scope 1}: Use {alternative skill/method} instead
- {Out of scope 2}: Requires {different authority/process}
- {Out of scope 3}: See {other resource}

## Primary Decision Tree

```
START: {Initial question/state}
│
├─ Condition A met?
│  ├─ Yes → Evaluate Criteria Set 1
│  │  ├─ High confidence → {Decision/Action A1}
│  │  └─ Low confidence → Gather more data on X
│  └─ No → Check Condition B
│
├─ Condition B met?
│  ├─ Yes → Evaluate Criteria Set 2
│  │  ├─ All criteria pass → {Decision/Action B1}
│  │  └─ Some criteria fail → {Decision/Action B2}
│  └─ No → Check Condition C
│
└─ Default Case
   └─ → {Conservative default action}
```

## Evaluation Criteria

### Criteria Set 1: {Name}
| Factor | Weight | How to Evaluate | Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| {factor1} | High | {measurement method} | {pass value} |
| {factor2} | Medium | {measurement method} | {pass value} |
| {factor3} | Low | {measurement method} | {pass value} |

**Decision Formula**: {How to combine factors}

### Criteria Set 2: {Name}
- **Must Have**: {List of non-negotiable requirements}
- **Should Have**: {List of important but flexible requirements}
- **Nice to Have**: {List of optional enhancements}

**Scoring**: Must have = 100%, Should have = 70%, Nice to have = 30%

## Context Gathering

### Required Information
Before making decision, gather:
1. {Information type 1}: Found in {location/source}
2. {Information type 2}: Obtained by {method}
3. {Information type 3}: Calculated from {inputs}

### Information Quality Check
- [ ] Data is less than {time period} old
- [ ] Sources are {reliability standard}
- [ ] Coverage includes {minimum scope}
- [ ] Conflicts have been {resolution method}

## Decision Heuristics

### Quick Rules (80% Confidence)
1. If {condition}, then always {action}
2. If {condition}, then never {action}
3. If {condition}, then prefer {option}

### Edge Case Handling
| Situation | Recognition Signs | Recommended Action | Escalation Path |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| {edge1} | {signs} | {action} | {who to consult} |
| {edge2} | {signs} | {action} | {who to consult} |

## Risk Assessment

### Decision Risks
| Decision | Risk Level | Consequences | Mitigation |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| {option1} | Low/Med/High | {what could go wrong} | {how to prevent/handle} |
| {option2} | Low/Med/High | {what could go wrong} | {how to prevent/handle} |

### Reversibility Matrix
- **Easily Reversible**: {list decisions}
- **Reversible with Effort**: {list decisions}
- **Difficult to Reverse**: {list decisions}
- **Irreversible**: {list decisions}

## Implementation Guidance

### Once Decision is Made
1. Document decision rationale in {location}
2. Communicate to {stakeholders} via {method}
3. Set up monitoring for {metrics}
4. Schedule review at {checkpoint}

### Success Metrics
- **Immediate**: {what to check right away}
- **Short-term** (1 week): {early indicators}
- **Long-term** (1 month): {full validation}

## Historical Patterns

### What Has Worked
- Pattern: {description} → Outcome: {result}
- Pattern: {description} → Outcome: {result}

### What Has Failed
- Anti-pattern: {description} → Problem: {what went wrong}
- Anti-pattern: {description} → Problem: {what went wrong}

## Escalation Protocol

When to escalate instead of deciding:
1. {Condition requiring escalation}
2. {Condition requiring escalation}
3. {Condition requiring escalation}

Escalation path:
1. First: {immediate escalation point}
2. Then: {secondary escalation}
3. Finally: {ultimate authority}

## Decision Log Template

```markdown
Date: {timestamp}
Decision: {what was decided}
Context: {relevant conditions}
Criteria Evaluated: {which criteria sets}
Score: {quantified if applicable}
Confidence: {High/Medium/Low}
Rationale: {why this decision}
Alternative Considered: {what else was evaluated}
Review Date: {when to revisit}
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **{Pitfall 1}**: {Why it happens} → {How to avoid}
2. **{Pitfall 2}**: {Why it happens} → {How to avoid}
3. **{Pitfall 3}**: {Why it happens} → {How to avoid}
