## Understanding the Patent Grant

Our CLA includes a **narrow patent grant** that protects both you and the project:

see: license_details/CONTRIBUTOR-LICENSE-AGREEMENT.md

**What you're granting**: Rights to patents necessarily infringed by your specific
code implementation.

**What you're keeping**: Rights to broader process/algorithm patents that could
be implemented in other ways.

**Example**: If you contribute an implementation of a novel phase-retrieval
algorithm:

- We can use your code implementation ✓
- You retain patent rights to the algorithm itself ✓
- Others could implement the same algorithm differently without infringing
  your patent (if you have one) ✓

This is called a "necessary infringement" standard and is common in open source
projects like Apache, W3C, and others.
