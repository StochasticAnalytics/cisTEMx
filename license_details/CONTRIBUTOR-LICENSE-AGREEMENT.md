STOCHASTIC ANALYTICS, LLC
INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT
Version 2.0 - Narrow Patent Grant

Thank you for your interest in contributing to cisTEMx (the "Project"),
a software project managed by Stochastic Analytics, LLC ("Company" or "We").

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") clarifies the intellectual
property license granted with Contributions. You retain ownership of your
copyright and broader patent rights while granting us the specific rights
needed to distribute and sublicense your Contributions under our dual-licensing
model.

## 1. Definitions

**"You"** (or **"Your"**) means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized
by the copyright owner that is executing this Agreement.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted
by You to the Company for inclusion in the Project. This includes source code,
documentation, configuration files, and related materials.

**"Essential Patent Claims"** means only those patent claims licensable by You
that are **necessarily infringed** by Your Contribution alone or by the
combination of Your Contribution with the specific version of the Project to
which it was submitted, where such infringement could not have been avoided by
another technically reasonable way of implementing Your Contribution.

**"Process Patent Claims"** means patent claims covering methods, algorithms,
or processes that may be implemented in various ways beyond the specific code
implementation in Your Contribution.

---

## 2. Grant of Copyright License (Non-Exclusive)

**You retain ownership of the copyright in Your Contributions.**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Company and to recipients of software distributed by the Company a **perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable** copyright
license to:

(a) Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works;

(b) **Sublicense** Your Contributions under multiple licenses as determined by
    the Company, including but not limited to open source licenses (such as
    Mozilla Public License 2.0) and commercial licenses.

**Clarification**: This is a license grant, not a copyright assignment. You
retain all rights to use Your Contributions in any way You choose, including
in other projects, commercial products, or publications.

---

## 3. Grant of Patent License (Narrow Scope)

### 3.1 Limited Patent Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Company and to recipients of software distributed by the Company a **perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable** (except as
stated in Section 3.3) patent license under Your **Essential Patent Claims** to:

- Make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
  Your Contribution and the Contribution in combination with the Project.

**Important Limitation**: This license applies **only** to Your Essential Patent
Claims as defined above - those patent claims that are **necessarily infringed**
by Your specific code Contribution.

### 3.2 Process Patents Explicitly Excluded

This Agreement does **NOT** grant any license to Your Process Patent Claims.
If Your Contribution implements a novel algorithm, computational method, or
scientific process for which You hold or may obtain patent rights, You retain
full rights to those patents except as they are necessarily infringed by the
specific code implementation You contributed.

**Example**: If You contribute code implementing a novel cryo-EM reconstruction
algorithm for which You later obtain a patent, this Agreement:

- **DOES** grant rights to use Your specific code implementation
- **DOES NOT** grant rights to the broader algorithm/process that could be
  implemented in other ways

The distinction is between:

- **Copyright** (protects the expression/code itself) - broadly licensed.
- **Patents on the code's necessary implementation** - narrowly licensed.
- **Patents on broader processes/methods** - retained by You.

### 3.3 Patent License Termination

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or the Company alleging
that Your Contribution or the Project constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, any patent licenses granted under this Agreement to that entity
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 3.4 Defensive Termination Right

You may terminate the patent license granted in Section 3.1 if the Company
institutes patent infringement proceedings against You, except where such
proceedings are for Defensive Purposes. "Defensive Purposes" means claims
asserted in response to a patent infringement lawsuit filed against the
Company.

---

## 4. Explicit Right to Multiple Licensing

You acknowledge and agree that the Company intends to distribute the Project
under a dual-licensing model:

(a) Open source license (Mozilla Public License 2.0) for academic and non-profit
    use; and
(b) Commercial licenses negotiated on a case-by-case basis.

You hereby grant to the Company the right to sublicense Your Contributions under
any such licenses. **You retain the right to license Your own Contributions
under any terms You choose for Your own purposes.

---

## 5. Copyright Ownership and Attribution

### 5.1 Retained Ownership

You retain full ownership of the copyright in Your Contributions. This Agreement
is a license, not an assignment

### 5.2 Attribution

Your Contributions will be attributed to You in the Project's version control
system and contributor records. The Company will maintain reasonable attribution
practices.

### 5.3 File Headers

Files containing Your Contributions may include copyright notices such as:

## 6. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If Your employer has
rights to intellectual property You create, You represent that You have
permission to make Contributions or that Your employer has waived such rights
or executed a Corporate CLA.

(b) Each Contribution is Your original creation, or You have sufficient rights
to submit it under this Agreement.

(c) Your Contribution does not, to Your knowledge, violate any third-party
intellectual property rights.

(d) If You have knowledge of any patent claims (including Your own) that would
be infringed by the Project with Your Contribution, You will disclose them in
Your Contribution submission.

---

## 7. Third-Party Work

If You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You must:
(a) Identify it clearly as third-party work;
(b) Provide complete information about its source and license; and
(c) Mark it as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [name and license]"

## 8. No Support Obligation

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions. Unless required
by law or agreed in writing, You provide Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.

---

## 9. Clarification on Software vs. Process Protection

### 9.1 Copyright Protects Code Expression

Copyright protects Your specific code, comments, documentation, and the way You
expressed the solution. This Agreement grants broad rights to this expression
to enable distribution.

### 9.2 Patents Protect Inventive Concepts

Patents protect the underlying inventive concepts, algorithms, and processes.
This Agreement grants only **narrow** patent rights limited to claims
necessarily infringed by Your specific code contribution.

### 9.3 Your Retained Rights

You retain:

- Copyright ownership (though extensively licensed)
- Patent rights to broader implementations of any processes
- Rights to use Your Contributions in any other context
- Rights to publish about algorithms/methods in Your Contributions

## 10. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify the Company if You become aware of facts that would make
these representations inaccurate.

---

## 11. Governing Law

without regard to conflict of law provisions.
